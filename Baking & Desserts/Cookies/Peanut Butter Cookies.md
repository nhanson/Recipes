# Crispy Amish Peanut Butter Cookies

*I think this is my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe. The cookies are crisp and intensely flavored with brown sugar and peanut butter. The batter is very crumbly, but don't worry about it; the end result is perfect. The cookies are not perfect rounds when baked, but that's the way they are supposed to be. Believe me, no one will complain!*

## Ingredients
5 cups all-purpose flour  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 tablespoon baking soda  
2 teaspoons baking powder  

1&frac12; cups vegetable shortening  
1 18-ounce jar creamy peanut butter (generous 2 cups)  
2&frac12; cups granulated sugar (divided)  
2 cups firmly packed dark brown sugar  
4 eggs, beaten  
4 teaspoons vanilla  

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 375&deg;.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder, set aside.  
In a mixer bowl, beat the shortening briefly, then gradually beat in the peanut butter, then 2 cups of granulated sugar and the brown sugar. Blend well.  
Add the beaten eggs a bit at a time, then add the vanilla.  
Gradually add the flour mixture and incorporate thoroughly.  
The batter will be very crumbly, but not to worry.  
Place the remaining &frac12; cup granulated sugar in a small bowl.  
Use a &frac12;-inch cookie scoop or a heaping tablespoon to make balls of batter, lightly roll each cookie in the sugar.  
Transfer the cookies to an ungreased cookie sheet.  
With a fork, press each cookie down a bit in a crisscross pattern to flatten.  
Bake for 10 to 11 minutes or until brown.  
Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the pan.  
Transfer cookies to an airtight container or the freezer.
