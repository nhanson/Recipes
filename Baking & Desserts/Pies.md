# Pies

*Early English settlers of the Atlantic Coast brought their love of pies with them. These included meat, game, fish, fowl, fruit, and berry pies, and a variety of pastry. There were also cream, custard, and other open-face pies, but these were listed in old English cookbooks as puddings. As late as the mid-nineteenth century, some American cookbooks listed custard pies as puddings, although mainly by that time the custard was baked in a pie pan with a rim of pastry around the edge and no under crust.*  
*In early America and well up into the nineteenth century, pie was a standard breakfast dish. Since the men of rural families rose early and had an hour or more of outside chores before breakfast, there was time to make such treats.*  
*If winters were cold, pies were made in quantity and put out to freeze. The varieties were limited to the supplies at hand, but dried fruit was always available to the thrifty housekeeper. Sometimes the pies were layered. For instance, fresh or dried and simmered apple slices might be topped with custard or a cottage cheese custard; and mince might be topped with apple, cranberries, pumpkin, or sometimes apple and custard. Such recipes do not appear in cookbooks, but have come down to us in old diaries or literature of the time.*  

## Apple Pie
*So common has apple pie always been in this country — although it did not originate here — that many old American cookbooks did bother to give a recipe. It was taken for granted that every housewife had her own favorite.*  

### Ingredients
5 cups peeled, cored, and thinly sliced apples  
&frac12; to &frac34; cup sugar  
&frac12; to 1 teaspoon cinnamon  
&frac14; teaspoon salt  
2 tablespoons butter  
Lemon juice (optional)  
[Pastry](../Extras/Flaky%20Pie%20Dough.md) for two-crust 9-inch pie  

### Instructions
*Note: Whether to prepare the crust or the apples first is a matter of choice. If you are a quick pastry maker, then you'll probably want to start with the apples.*

Combine apples with the sugar, cinnamon, and salt.  
Turn into a 9-inch pie pan lined with pastry.  
Dot the apples with butter and moisten the edge of the trimmed bottom crust.  
Put on the top pastry, trim, and crimp the edge.  
Bake in a 450&deg; oven 15 minutes.  
Reduce the heat to 350&deg; and bake from 20 to 35 minutes longer.  

*Note: The length of time will depend upon the type of apples used. Summer apples, such as Transparents or Gravensteins, which should be used slightly green or underripe, will cook very quickly. It is best to leave a slit in the center of the pie crust so that the apples can be tested with a fork without disturbing the crust. If using very ripe apples or sweet apples, sprinkle with a tablespoon or two of lemon juice before adding the top crust.*  
*Serve apple pie warm or cold, plain or with aged Cheddar cheese, a cheese sauce, or ice cream, which makes it "à la mode."*  

## Deep-Dish Apple Pie
*This was often made along with a regular two-crust pie and left for future use, since it had no bottom crust to become soggy on standing. An inverted egg cup, or, for a large pie, an inverted tea- cup, was placed in the pie pan or casserole before the filling was put in. This gathered the juice and held up the crust. Here is a recipe for a small deep-dish pie, requiring a 9&times;9&times;2-inch pan.*  

### Ingredients
6 cups cored, peeled, and thinly sliced apples  
&frac78; cup sugar (1 cup minus 2 tablespoons)  
1 teaspoon cinnamon  
2 or 3 tablespoons butter  
Lemon juice (optional)  
[Pastry](../Extras/Flaky%20Pie%20Dough.md) for one-crust 9-inch pie  

### Instructions
Roll the pastry so it will extend about 1&frac12; inch beyond the sides of the pan.  
Invert the pan on the pastry and cut around it, leaving a &frac12;-inch margin. *The amount of pastry used will depend upon whether you prefer a thick or thin crust.*  
Roll the trimmings slightly wider, drape over the edge of the pan, and moisten the top.  
Mix the apples with the sugar and cinnamon.  
Sprinkle with a little lemon juice if they are of a sweet variety or seem a little old.  
Turn into the pan and dot with butter.  
Adjust the top crust in place and press against the moistened bottom dough to seal.  
Cut slits or a design in the top to allow for the escape of steam, and crimp the edges.  
Bake in a 450&deg; oven 15 minutes.  
Reduce the heat to 350&deg;, and bake 25 to 40 minutes longer, depending upon the variety of apples used.  
Serve hot or cold with cream, ice cream, or Cheddar cheese.  

## Berry Pies
*Wild or cultivated berries have long been top choice for pies, Here again, as for apples, there are few recipes for berry pies in old cookbooks, although they are mentioned in diaries and books from early American life. Apparently it was assumed that homemakers would know how to prepare them.*  

### Ingredients
4 cups prepared berries  
&frac34; to 1&frac12; cups sugar  
4 to 6 tablespoons flour or 2 to 3 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca  
&frac14; teaspoon salt  
1 tablespoon lemon juice (for sweet berries)  
1 to 2 tablespoons butter  
[Pastry](../Extras/Flaky%20Pie%20Dough.md) for two-crust 9-inch pie  

### Instructions

Pick over the berries. If they need washing, do not run water through them but put in a sieve or colander and dip up and down in a bowl of water, changing water if necessary. Drain well.
Combine with the sugar, flour or tapioca, salt, and (if used) lemon juice.
Turn into a pastry-lined pie pan and dot with butter.
Trim the pastry edge and moisten it.
Cover with the top pastry, trim the edge, crimp the top and bottom edges together, and cut vents for steam.
Bake at 450&deg; 15 minutes, reduce the heat to 350&deg;, and bake 25 to 30 minutes longer.
Cool on a rack.
Berry pies are usually served cold, although they can be served slightly warm.
They are especially popular topped with ice cream.

### Blueberry, Raspberry, or Strawberry Pie:
*These sweet berries usually require only about 3/4 cup sugar. However, if using lemon juice, add about 2 tablespoons more sugar for each tablespoon of lemon juice. Baked strawberry pie is not as popular as the others, but if you are making it, slice the berries. They are very juicy, so the maximum amount of flour (6 tablespoons) or quick-cooking tapioca (3 tablespoons) is preferred. Strawberries are considered best for pies when used fresh and then glazed. This is true also of raspberries and blueberries.*

### Wild Huckleberry Pie:
*Use 1 cup sugar and 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice. The amount of thickening depends on whether you like a rather runny or a firm pie.*

### Loganberry Pie:
*This tart, delicious berry used to be a favorite garden and commercial berry, but for some reason has lost its popularity in the past 30 years. Use 1&frac14; to 1&frac12; cups sugar and 5 to 6 tablespoons flour.*

### Blackberry Pie:
*There are many new commercial varieties of this fruit, as well as the tiny wild, flavorful blackberries found along the roadsides and fences. They can all be treated the same. For very ripe berries, wild or commercially grown, use 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice to enhance the flavor. The amount of thickening depends upon personal taste. Many of the new varieties of commercial blackberries are favored for use fresh in glazed pies.* 

### Elderberry Pie:
*Generally elderberry bushes are not commercially for their fruit, and the berries must be gathered from the tall wild bushes or trees. Pick when fully ripe or the fruit will have an acrid taste. Blue elderberries are considered best. Strip the berries from the stem and proceed as in the basic recipe. Use 1 cup sugar and 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice in the filling.*
