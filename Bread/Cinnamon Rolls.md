# Cinnamon Rolls - Carolyn's Favorite

## Ingredients
4 to 4&frac13; cups all-purpose flour  
1 pkg active dry yeast  
1 cup milk  
&frac13; cup sugar  
&frac13; cup butter  
&frac12; teaspoon salt  
2 eggs  

## Instructions
Combine 1&frac12; cups flour and the yeast, set aside.  
Heat and stir milk, sugar, butter and salt till warm (120-130&deg;) and butter almost melts. Add to flour mixture. Then add eggs. Mix well.  
Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can.  
On a floured surface, knead in the remaining flour to make a soft dough that is smooth and elastic (3-5 minutes).  
Shape into a ball. Placed in a greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place till double (about 1 hour).  
Punch down. Let rest 10 minutes.  
Shape dough into a 12x8 inch rectangle.  
Brush with melted butter.  
In a small bowl mix &frac12; cup sugar and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  
Sprinkle sugar-cinnamon mixture over the top of the melted butter.  
Sprinkle with additional &frac34; cup raisins and &frac34; cup of nuts if desired.  
Roll up jelly-roll style starting from the long side. Pinch seam to seal.  
Cut into 8 pieces, placing cut-side down in a well-buttered 9x13 pan.  
Cover and let rise till nearly double (about 30 minutes) or cover with oiled wax paper, then plastic wrap, and refrigerate 2 to 24 hours.  
If chilled, let stand, covered for 20 minutes at room temperature.  
Bake at 375&deg; for 20 to 25 minutes.  
Cool.  
Drizzle with powdered sugar icing.  
Serve warm or cool.
