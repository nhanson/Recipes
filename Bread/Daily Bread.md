# Daily Bread

*Newspaper article from the Los Angeles Times*

## Ingredients
2 cups warm water  
1&frac14;-ounce package instant dry yeast  
1 teaspoon sugar  
5 to 5&frac12; cups all-purpose flour, divided, plus extra for forming and dusting  
2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra for coating  
1 cup wheat germ  
3 teaspoons kosher salt  

## Instructions
In a large mixing bowl, stir together 2 cups of warm water (120-130&deg;), yeast, sugar and 1 cup flour.  
Let sit 15 minutes.  
If the yeast doesn't activate, you have to throw this out and start over, although this rarely happens.  
With a wooden spoon, bread cutter or your hands, mix in the olive oil, wheat germ and 3 cups flour.  
Gradually add salt and more flour, letting the dough come together.  
Knead dough on a floured board or table, adding the rest of the flour as needed; be careful not to get the dough too dry.  
If using herbs or other flavorings, knead them in at this point, adding more flour if the dough gets too sticky.  
Once the flour is incorporated, knead dough for about 10 minutes, until elastic; test by sticking your floured finger into the dough to see if it bounces back.  
Shape dough into a round and put it into a bowl coated with about 2 teaspoon olive oil (coat the dough's surface, too).  
Cover with plastic wrap and let rise, 1&frac12; hours.  
Punch down the dough, shape it back into a ball, and let it rise for the second fermentation, about 30 miniutes.  
Punch down the dough again, divide into two portions, and shape each portion into a batard.  
Press the dough into a roughly 10&times;7-inch rectangle.  
With the long side of the rectangle facing toward you, grasp the upper corners of the dough and fold them to meet in the center of the dough, creating a peak at the top.  
Fold down the peak to the center seam. Press the entire seam to seal it, pushing it away from you.  
Roll down the top edge of the dough, pushing it down and away from you as you go, until you reach the bottom edge.  
Press along the length of the seam and roll it forward so that the seam is undemeath. Repeat with the second portion of dough.  
Heat oven to 475&deg;, with an inverted baking sheet on the middle rack.  
Cover the shaped batards with plastic wrap lightly coated with oil (or vegetable oil spray).  
Let rise for hour on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.  
Dust the loaves with flour and slash with a razor or bread knife.  
Slide the parchment paper with the batards onto the baking sheet in the oven and spray the sides and bottom of the oven (but not the batards) with a water mister. Shut the door.  
Spray again in about 5 minutes.  
Do not open the door more than you have to.  
Watch the loaves and rotate them once during baking for even coloring.  
Bake until golden, about 45 minutes.  
Remove and allow to cool on a rack.
