# Confectioners' Icing

## Ingredients
1 cup sifted powdered sugar  
&frac14; teaspoon vanilla  
Milk

## Instructions
Combine powdered sugar, vanilla, and enough milk to make of drizzling consistency (about &frac12; tablespoons).  
Cool bread slightly before icing. A wire rack with waxed paper underneath works well and makes cleanup easy.  
From a spoon, drizzle icing back and forth across loaf. Or, spread with a spatula.  
Be sure to add nuts, fruits, or other decorations before icing sets.  

### *Ices 2 loaves.*
