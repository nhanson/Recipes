# Flaky Pie Dough

*Bakers like to talk about the "secrets" of making great pie crusts. In truth, there are tips, but no unknowable secrets and nothing daunting enough to explain why cool, calm, collected types turn nervous at the thought of tackling a pie crust.*  
*Like the fillings they cradle, crusts have personalities: crisp, tender, and flaky-or some combination thereof. Which traits are dominant is, in good measure, a result of ingredients: Butter is the great giver of flavor and vegetable shortening the flake maker; together they produce a crust both flaky and tender, sweet and full-flavored, the kind most prized by American pie hands. This mixed crust (the best example of which follows) can be used for pies and tarts, sweet and savory, American- or European-style.*  
*An all-butter dough (like the Chocolate Dough, page 372, and its nonchocolate version) will give you a crisp, sturdy crust with little flakiness (unless the butter is left in largish pieces). When prebaked on its own, a butter crust will stand firm against juicy fillings. Handled properly, a butter crust is strong enough to be rolled out and molded into a free-fonn shape or a galette (see page 371). For most bakers, an all-shortening crust is usually not an option, because, although it produces lots of flake, it delivers almost no flavor.*  
*If you could have only one pie dough in your repertoire (heaven forbid), it would have to be this one, the classic dough that earns blue ribbons at county fairs and stars at esteemed pastry shops. The mix of butter and shortening guarantees that the dough will be flaky, flavorful, and tender. You can use this dough to make any kind of pie or tart, sweet or savory, plain or fancy. It is easy to roll and crimp and is made quickly by hand, in a mixer, or food processor. The recipe is large and can be cut in half or even quartered, but since the dough can be frozen for up to a month, it's practical to make the full batch. You can freeze the dough in disks, rolled out in circles, or already fitted into pie pans or tart molds, ready to go into the oven-without thawing-when you're in a crunch for a crust.*  

## Ingredients
$5 \frac 14$ cups pastry flour or all-purpose flour  
$1$ tablespoon kosher salt  
$1 \frac 12$ sticks (6 ounces) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces  
$1 \frac 34$ cups (11 ounces) solid vegetable shortening, chilled  
$1$ cup ice water  

## Instructions
### TO MAKE THE DOUGH BY HAND:
Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl.
Add the butter and, using a pastry blender (or your fingers, if you prefer), cut it into the flour until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs.
Be patient-this takes a while.
Break up the shortening and add it in bits to the bowl.
Still working with the pastry blender (or your fingers), cut in the shortening until the mixture has small clumps and curds.
Switch to a wooden spoon and add the ice water, stirring to incorporate it.
Turn the dough out onto a work surface and fold it over on itself a few times-don't get carried away.
The dough will be soft, but it will firm sufficiently in the refrigerator.

### TO MAKE THE DOUGH IN A MIXER FITTED WITH THE PADDLE ATTACHMENT:
Put the flour and salt into the bowl and stir to mix.
Add the butter and mix on low until it is cut into the dry ingredients and the mixture looks coarse and crumbly.
Add the shortening in small bits and continue to mix on low.
When the mixture is clumpy and curdy and holds together when a small bit is pressed between your fingers, add the water and mix only until it is incorporated.
Turn the dough out onto a work surface and fold it over on itself two or three times, just to finish the mixing and to gather it together.

### To MAKE THE DOUGH IN A FOOD PROCESSOR:
Start with very cold ingredients and take care not to overwork them.
Place the dry ingredients in the food processor fitted with a metal blade and pulse just to mix.
Take the top off, scatter the chilled cubed butter and shortening over the flour, cover, and pulse again, working only until the fats are cut in and the mixture resembles slightly moist cornmeal.
Add a little of the liquid and pulse a few times, then add more liqtlid and pulse again.
Continue until the mixture has curds and clumps and sticks together when pressed between your fingers.
Don't process until the dough forms a ball that rides on the blade-that's overdoing it.

#### Chilling the Dough:
Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or for as long as 5 days. When the dough is thoroughly chilled and finn, it is ready to roll out and use in any recipe calling for flaky pie crust.

#### Storing:
The dough can be kept in the refrigerator for 5 days or frozen for 1 month. It's a good idea to divide the dough into quarters for freezing since one quarter of the recipe is generally enough for one pie crust or tart shell. Defrost, still wrapped, in the refrigerator.

### Pie Dough by Hand:
With a pastry blender, cut chilled butter into the flour and salt until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Cut in the chilled shortening until it forms curds.
Add the ice water gradually and toss to blend.
When the dough is sufficiently moist, pinch it-it will stick together.
Lightly gather the dough into a round and chill before rolling.


*Tips on Perfect Pie Dough:*  
*There are a few general rules that obtain no matter what kind of crust or filling you choose; follow these and you and your crust will be golden. (In fact, these same tips will help you make lovely biscuits and scones too.)*

- *Work in a bowl that's large enough for you to dig into with both hands.*
- *Always use unsalted butter and make sure it is extremely cold. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes before adding it to the flour.*
- *Use a pastry blender or your fingertips to cut the butter into the flour. Work as quickly as you comfortably can and stop when the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.*
- *When you use solid vegetable shortening, chill it and cut it into chunks a bit bigger than the butter cubes. Work the shortening into the dough until the mixture forms moist clumps and curds-when you add the liquid, you'll get even larger clumps.*
- *Keep the liquid icy-cold. Add it a spoonful at a time, using a fork to toss the mixture and incorporate the liquid into the dough. When the dough has curds and clumps that stick together when lightly pressed between your fingers, it's just right. If you have any doubts, keep in mind that it's better to add too much liquid than too little; too little, and the crust will be dry and difficult to roll.*
- *Gently gather the dough into a round and then flatten it into a rough approximation of the shape you'll be rolling it into.*
- *Chill it. Even if the dough feels cool to the touch, give it at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour, in the refrigerator. This rest gives the gluten (the protein that forms webs in flour) a chance to calm down so that when you start to roll the dough, it won't spring back.*
- *Roll the dough on a flour-dusted smooth, cool surface-marble is great, chilled marble is ideal.*
- *Roll the dough from the center out, rolling on one side and making certain to roll across the entire surface of the dough evenly. Lift the dough frequently to make sure it doesn't stick. As you roll, turn the dough-an eighth of a turn each time will keep it round.*
- *Transfer the dough to your pie or tart pan either by folding the dough in quarters, centering it in the pan, and unfolding it, or by rolling it up around your rolling pin and unrolling it over the pan.*
- *Don't pull or stretch the dough-what you stretch now will shrink back later. Gently work the dough into the pan, lifting it to get a smooth fit against the bottom and up the sides. Follow the recipe's directions for forming and crimping the edge of the pie or tart.*
- *Chill the crust. Whether you are going to bake the crust blind (that is, bake it without filling, lined with foil or parchment and filled with pie weights or beans) or with a filling, give it a rest in the refrigerator. It's had a tough workout during the rolling and the gluten needs another chance to relax.*

### *Makes enough dough for four 9- to 10-inch tarts or open-faced pies or 2 double-crusted pies*
