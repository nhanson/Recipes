# Tea Guide
There are many ways to make tea-none of them wrong-but here's a good guideline to get you started:
| Tea Type         | Teaspoons | Temperature  | Steeping Time |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Black            | 1         | 190-209&deg; | 3-5 minutes   |
| Green            | 1-2       | 170-190&deg; | 1-3 minutes   |
| Oolong           | 1-2       | 160-180&deg; | 1-3 minutes   |
| White            | 2+        | 150-170&deg; | 1-2 minutes   |
| Yellow           | 1-2       | 170-190&deg; | 1-3 minutes   |
| Pu-erh           | 1-2       | 190-209&deg; | 2-5 minutes   |
| Herbal Infusions | 1-2       | 190-209&deg; | 3-5 minutes   |

Tips:
- To make a tea stronger, don't sleep it for longer, as that will usually make it bitter. Add more leaves instead!
- As a general rule, use one level teaspoon or 2 grains for every cup (8 oz) you're making. Fluffier ingredients like mint and chamomile, or teas like green tea or oolong could use an extra teaspoon.
- Tea bag teas are usually one per cup (8 oz) of tea, though you can always double-up when you want it stronger!
- Spring water is ideal for brewing, but not necessary for making a good cup of tea
â€“ Many teas are good for a second...even third...steeping. Multiple steepings can bring out more subtle flavors and notes. Commonly, oolong
and pu-erh fall into this category. Give it a shot you might end up liking ihe second infusion better than the first!

As always experiment with steeping time, water temperature and tea amount! If a tea doesn't taste quite right the first time around, play with your <!-- m e --> flavor you enoy.
