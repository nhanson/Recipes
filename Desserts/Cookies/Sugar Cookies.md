# Light-as-Air Sugar Cookies

*Light, airy, and crunchy are the three adjectives that spring to mind when you first bite into these tender cookies. The combination of vanilla and almond extracts gives them a subtle, sophisticated flavor. Note that 1/4 teaspoon almond extract lends the merest hint of almond to these cookies. If you're someone who just can't get enough of that almond flavor, increase it to 1/2 (or even 3/4) teaspoon.*

## Ingredients
$\frac 12$ cup (2 ounces) confectioners' sugar  
$\frac 12$ cup (3.5 ounces) granulated sugar  
$\frac 12$ cup (1 stick, 4 ounces) unsalted butter  
$\frac 12$ cup (3.5 ounces) vegetable oil  
$1$ large egg  
$1$ teaspoon vanilla extract  
$\frac 14$ to $\frac 12$ teaspoon almond extract  
$\frac 12$ teaspoon salt  
$2$ teaspoons baking powder  
$2 \frac 12$ cups (10.5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour  

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350&deg;.  
Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.  
In a large bowl, cream together the sugars, butter, and oil until smooth and light-colored.  
Beat in the egg, vanilla and almond extracts, salt, and baking powder.  
Mix in the flour.  
Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and place them on the prepared baking sheets.  
Using the bottom of a drinking glass dipped in granulated sugar, flatten the balls to 1/4 inch thick.  
Bake the cookies for 10 minutes, until they're a very light brown around the edges.  
Remove them from the oven and transfer to a rack to cool.
