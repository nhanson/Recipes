# Chicken Tortilla Soup

*Here’s my version (combination of a couple of crock-pot recipes) of Chicken Tortilla Soup:*

## Ingredients
2 cans Chicken broth  
2 cans Black beans (sometimes I use 1 black bean and 1 kidney bean)  
2 cans Diced tomatoes  
1 can tomato sauce  
1 cup salsa  
2 cups corn (I use frozen)  
1 to 2 cups shredded chicken (I use all of the rotisserie chicken breast meat)  

## Instructions
Put all ingredients in crock-pot. Heat 2-4 hours, until completely hot.  
Serve with tortilla chips, shredded cheese, sour cream, green chilies, or anything else you’d like to go
with tortillas.
