# Chicken Pot Pie

## Ingredients
6 tablespoons butter  
6 tablespoons flour  
2 cups chicken broth  
1 cup heavy cream  
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper  
Salt  
4 cups large chunks of cooked chicken  
12 small white onions, cooked  
&frac34; cup peas, cooked  
&frac34; cup carrots, cooked  
&frac34; cup celery, cooked  
1 recipe [Basic Pastry](../Extras/Flaky%20Pie%20Dough.md) for 9-inch shell  

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 425&deg;.  
Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  
Slowly add the broth, cream, pepper, and salt to taste.  
Cook for 5 minutes, until thickened and smooth.  
Put the chicken pieces in a deep pie plate or casserole, cover with sauce, and stir in the small onions, peas, carrots, and celery.  
Place the prepared piecrust over the casserole, allowing enough overhang so that the edges can be crimped.  
Cut vents in the crust to allow the steam to escape.  
Bake for 25â€“30 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned.  

### Chicken Pie Country Style
Use 1 recipe [Baking Powder Biscuits](../Baking%20%26%20Desserts/Baking%20Powder%20Biscuits.md) instead of Basic Pastry.  
Roll out the biscuit dough 5-inch thick, cut in 2-inch rounds, and place them, edges touching, all over the top of the pie.  
Bake at 450&deg; for 15-20 minutes, until browned.
