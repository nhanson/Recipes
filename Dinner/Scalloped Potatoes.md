## Ingredients
Par boiled potatoes (skins on or off, sliced about &frac18;-inch thick)

## Instructions
Cook potatoes (par boil) first; then slice to about &frac18;-inch thick  
Meanwhile, for cheese sauce, in a saucepan, melt butter; stir in flour and pepper.  
Add milk all at once. Cook and stir till slightly thickened and bubbly.  
Add shredded cheese; stir until melted.  
Layer sliced potatoes with cheese sauce into lasagna pan.
